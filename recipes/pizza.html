    <h3>A cheesy homemade pepperoni pizza</h3>
    <p>This is going to be your new favorite</p>
    <div>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade (I like this no-knead
          version, though note that this recipe makes enough dough for 2 pizzas)
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (see below)</li>
        <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
        <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
        <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>For the Quick Pizza Sauce:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated onion</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Instructions</h4>

          Preheat the oven: Preheat oven to 500Â°F. If you are using a pizza
          stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice
          and hot as we
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the sauce: If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the
          ingredients. The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza.
          You can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.

          Roll out the dough: Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If
          it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room
          temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a
          14-inch diameter circle.

          Add the toppings: Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel.
          Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron. Add sauce in a light
          layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the
          edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top
          the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season
          with black pepper.

        <li>
          Cook the pizza: If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza
          into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then
          rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8
          minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slice and serve: Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting
          board. Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season
          with fresh oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.
